Barrel Columns

How many neurons in a barrel column?
	- 2550 neurons where measured, located in the C2 barrel column
	- mouse C2 barrel column is ~300 micro meters in diameter
	- the number of neurons per barrel column varies substantially, even within individual animals
Excitatory vs Inhibitory neurons
	- depending on the layer of the C2 barrel column, anywhere between 500 and 1500 cells where found to be excitatory
Excitatory vs Inhibitory synaptic connectivity
	- 254 excitatory synaptic connections where found among 1046 tested connections -> 24.3%

Hypercolumns

Neurons
	- hypercolumns consist of two populations of neurons
	- one inhibitory and one excitatory
	- hypercolumns are ~1mm in width
Microcolumns
	- ~100 microcolumns are estimated to be in a hypercolumn
